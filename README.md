# The-Efficacy-of-the-Covid-19-Vaccine

Early in the year 2020 the world was struck by the rampant spread of the Covid-19 virus, a deadly pathogen that required an unprecedented global response to curtail. Chief among the worldâ€™s focus was the creation of a vaccination against Covid-19, a goal that was achieved-with initial distribution following shortly after-in 2021. As this pandemic has had a global effect, most countries have tracked and reported data regarding many aspects of Covid-19 response including hospitalizations, infection rate, severity, mortality, testing, and vaccination rate. With this amount of data, from a global sample size, potentially predicting the long-term effects Covid-19 vaccination will have on the global Covid-19 response is not only possible, but it has become a social responsibility to do so.
